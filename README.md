# Data-Visualization-R---ggplot-
This Repo contains the project completed during Business Analytics and Big DataÂ´s Data Visualization course using R - ggplot.


- Data of CO2 emissions with a focus on new cars in the UK, the study will focus on a dataset of newly sold cars in the United Kingdom from 2000 to 2013. - The emphasis will be on CO2 emissions from those cars and other related variables. 

- To review the report and code it is recommended to download the HTML file: [code and HTML](https://github.com/BegonaFrigolet/Data_Vizualization_-R-_ggplot-/blob/main/Final%20HTML.html).

- All graphs can be found in this folder: 

## The three main insights:

 - 1. The CO2 emissions worldwide coming from transportation have been increasing, especially in most European countries.
 
 
 
 - 2. From the UK, we see that CO2 emissions are directly related to the engine capacity.


- 3. When it comes to fuel types, cars driving on Petrol are more polluting. Surprisingly though more than 50% of the cars available for sale in the country (between 2000 and 2013) consumed this type of fuel
